## Preliminary Preparation

Before you start this experiment, you need to have a working Kubernetes cluster and a working Gitlab installed, and then import the `go-hello-world` project into Gitlab.

If you don't need to localize your service, or if you don't feel comfortable installing Gitlab in your cluster, you can use the official Gitlab, Github, or even Gitee, as long as you have proper network access.
