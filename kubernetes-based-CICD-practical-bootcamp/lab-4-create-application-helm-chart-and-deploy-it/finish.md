## Experiment Summary

The purpose of this experiment was to take you through and use Helm. Through this experiment, we were able to develop Helm Chart from 0 to 1 and then deploy it to Kubernetes. In the enterprise, Helm can easily manage applications, and different types of applications can be made into a Chart, which can reduce the repetitive work of operation and maintenance and give us more time to do other things.

Let's roll back the entire experiment again:

- First, install the Helm client
- Use `helm create` to create the Charts template, and then customize it to suit your needs
- Use `helm install` to install the application
- Use `helm upgrade` to update the application
- Use `helm rollback` to roll back the application
- Use `helm uninstall` to uninstall the application

Of course, Helm can be very simple or very complex, so if you don't know much about it, you can go to the official website `https://helm.sh` for further study.
