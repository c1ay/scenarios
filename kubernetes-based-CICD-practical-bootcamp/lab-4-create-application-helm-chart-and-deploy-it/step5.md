Helm Chart packages can be saved to a local Gitlab repository, either as directories, like code, or as a zip archive.

In addition, you can also save to a number of specialized Chart repositories, the main ones currently in use are:

- Microsoft repository: `http://mirror.azure.cn/kubernetes/charts/`
- Aliyun repository: `https://kubernetes.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/charts`
- Official repository: `https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/incubator`
