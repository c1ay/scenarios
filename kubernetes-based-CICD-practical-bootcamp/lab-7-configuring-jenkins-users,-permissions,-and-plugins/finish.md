## Experiment Summary

This experiment revolves around the `Role-based Authorization Strategy` plug-in, which allows you to experiment with users, roles, and projects, and finally allows different users to manage different projects, and then introduces how to manage credentials in Jenkins.

The whole experiment is relatively simple, but it covers Jenkins plugin management, user management, permission management, view management, credential management, and project management, basically covering all the needs of everyday use of Jenkins.
