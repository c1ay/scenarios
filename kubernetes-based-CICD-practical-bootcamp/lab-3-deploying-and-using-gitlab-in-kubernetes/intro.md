## Introduction to Experimentation

Gitlab is a code repository that can be deployed in a number of ways. For enterprise use, you'll find a separate machine to deploy and manage it. For the sake of experimentation, here's a demonstration of how to deploy Gitlab in Kubernetes, with components that involve Redis, PostgreSQL, and Gitlab, and a demonstration of how to persist the code repository.
