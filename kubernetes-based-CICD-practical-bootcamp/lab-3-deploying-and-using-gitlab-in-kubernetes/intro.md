## Introduction to Experimentation

Gitlab is a code repository that can be deployed in a number of ways. For enterprise use, you'll find a separate machine to deploy and manage it. Here, for the sake of experimentation, we'll demonstrate how to deploy Gitlab in Kubernetes, with components that involve Redis, PostgreSQL, and Gitlab, and we'll show how to persist the code repository.
