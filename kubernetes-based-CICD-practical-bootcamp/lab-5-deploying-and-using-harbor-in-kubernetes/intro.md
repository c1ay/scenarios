## Introduction to the experiment

Our application images are eventually saved to a mirror repository, either the official repository Dockerhub, or a public cloud repository, or you can build your own mirror repository.

This experiment is to take you from 0 to 1 to build Harbor mirror repository, and complete the application image build, push, download.
