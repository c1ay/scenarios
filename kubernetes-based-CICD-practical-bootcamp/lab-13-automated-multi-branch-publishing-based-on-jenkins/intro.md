## Introduction to the experiment

In the enterprise, every project has many branches, such as development branch and test branch, each branch corresponds to a different environment, for example, the development branch releases the development environment, and the test branch releases the test environment, if we follow the way in the chapter "Automating application release based on Jenkins", we need to create different pipelines in different environments, so is there any way to create only one Is there a way to create just one pipeline to publish different branches to different environments? Today we'll walk you through how to do a multi-branch release based on Jenkins.
