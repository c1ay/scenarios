## Experiment Summary

This experiment introduced what Pipeline is, and how to develop a simple Pipeline and then deploy it in Jenkins. In complex enterprise environments, most of them use shared libraries, so this experiment also takes you from 0 to 1 to build and use a shared library, and in subsequent experiments, we will continue to enrich the shared library to meet daily needs.
