## What is DevOps

DevOps has been a hot topic of discussion for the past decade. 10 people have 10 Hamlets in their minds, 10 companies have more than 10 DevOps definitions, and you've probably heard more than 100 DevOps definitions in your career in technology.

So what exactly is DevOps?

According to Wikipedia, DevOps is a culture, movement, or practice that values communication and collaboration between "software developers (Devs)" and "IT operations staff (Ops). It makes building, testing, and releasing software faster, more frequent, and more reliable by automating the process of "software delivery" and "architectural change.

In my opinion, DevOps is a set of best practices for continuously improving and increasing the value of delivery around the entire software development lifecycle. With DevOps, there is a culture of equality between development, operations and maintenance, without being limited to specific roles.

DevOps emphasizes an engineering process that is both fast and steady through a series of means that enable each idea to continuously deliver value to users from the development to production cycle. It is a methodology that does not refer to a particular software tool or combination of software tools. Various tools or combinations of software can implement the DevOps conceptual approach. It is essentially a set of methodologies, not a collection of tools or tools, similar to OOP, AOP, IOC (or DI), etc., designed into software development as an abstraction or surrogate for a theory or process or method.
