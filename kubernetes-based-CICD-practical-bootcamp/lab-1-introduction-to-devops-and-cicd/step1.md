## What is CICD

CICD is an implementation of the DevOps culture, designed to allow applications to move forward in a pipeline from code check-in, testing, build and deployment through the production phase via the CICD pipeline. Once CICD is introduced, organizations can partially or fully automate it and speed up the delivery process, reducing communication costs and the cost of errors.
