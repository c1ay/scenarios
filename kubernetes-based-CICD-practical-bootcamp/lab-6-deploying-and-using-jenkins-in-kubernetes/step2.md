## Jenkins Deployment

There are many ways to deploy Jenkins, the main ones are as follows:

- WAR package standalone deployments
- RPM deployments
- Docker deployments

For convenience, Docker deployment is used here, and Kubernetes orchestration is used.

Create a `sy-02-1` directory in the `/home/shiyanlou/Code/devops/` directory with the following command:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/shiyanlou/Code/devops/sy-02-1
cd /home/shiyanlou/Code/devops/sy-02-1
```
