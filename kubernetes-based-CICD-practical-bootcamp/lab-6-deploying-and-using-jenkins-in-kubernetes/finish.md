## Experiment Summary

Now let's summarize the whole experiment.

First, we will take you through what Jenkins is and how to deploy it in Kubernetes, including data persistence, application access, etc. Then we will take you through the initialization of Jenkins and test whether the pipeline functions properly. In order to maximize the use of Kubernetes features, we will take you through the configuration of how to dynamically deploy Jenkins Slave based on Kubernetes. Through template customization and tag association, you can achieve different Slave associated with different tasks, and then you can configure multiple templates according to the actual situation in the enterprise, such as templates for Java applications, templates for Nodejs, etc.
