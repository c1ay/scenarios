## Experiment Summary

Now that we've finished publishing our `go-hello-world` project using Jenkins, let's review the process:

- First, we define the steps of the process
- Then, we developed code based on each step
- Finally, we put all the steps together into a Pipeline and test the release

Each step is not difficult, but the main thing is to master the logic of the development Pipeline, and, in the middle, many problems may arise, which need to be debugged slowly.
