## Experiment Summary

This experiment was about understanding what GitOps is and how it differs from traditional CDs, then introducing Argocd, one of the main characters of this course, and installing and using it in Kubernetes, and showing how to create an application on Argocd with a simple example. Argocd has a lot of features and a lot of companies have already gone into production, so we'll be doing all of our continuous delivery through Argocd.
